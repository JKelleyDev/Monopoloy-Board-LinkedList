# Monopoly Board Linked-List

## Overview
This project implements an understanding of abstract data types through the implementation of linked list. This is designed to perform multiple operations (Insert at head, tail, and position; Delete at head, tail, and position; search for a specific position; display elmeents of the list)   on a linked list.. The program is written in C++ and can be
executed from your local terminal. 

## How to Run the Code
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a C++ compilier installed in your file path. For instructions on installation of each see:
- 
  Linux / Mac:
  https://siytek.com/how-to-compile-cpp-on-a-mac/

  Windows:
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compiling-a-native-cpp-program-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170 

### Instructions
- Open up your local terminal and change to the directory with your file.cpp
- Next execute the compile command
    :g++ filepath/filename.cpp -o filename.exe
- Finally run your file with the following command 
    :./filename.exe
  
## Operations
1. insertAtHead
Description: This method creates a new node and inserts at the beginning of the list.
Time Complexity:
Best case: O([1)
Worst case: O(N)
List all Operations implemented in your project using the above format.

2. Name of Operation
Description: [Briefly describe how operation is performed in your code.]
Time Complexity:
Best case: O([best case time complexity])
Worst case: O([worst case time complexity])
List all Operations implemented in your project using the above format.

3. Name of Operation
Description: [Briefly describe how operation is performed in your code.]
Time Complexity:
Best case: O([best case time complexity])
Worst case: O([worst case time complexity])
